# Creative Project Management SaaS

## Description
This project is a lightweight SaaS application designed for managing creative projects. Users can create projects, add notes, upload images, and visually organize their ideas using a simple Kanban-style board. The focus is on minimalism, with a strong emphasis on sleek design and user experience inspired by [Koto Studio](https://koto.studio/work/bolt/).

## Technologies
We use **Supabase** as the core backend service, handling the database, user authentication, file storage, and hosting. Below is the tech stack:

### Frontend
- **React** with **Next.js**: For building interactive user interfaces and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn components (or **Styled Components**): For creating highly customizable and responsive styles.
- **Framer Motion**: For implementing fluid animations and transitions.
- **GraphQL**: (Optional) For flexible data querying if required.

### Backend and Hosting
- **Supabase**: Used for handling all backend functionality, including:
  - **PostgreSQL database**: For managing project data.
  - **ORM**: Used Drizzle as ORM
  - **User authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
  - **Storage**: For managing user-uploaded images.
  - **API hosting**: Supabase functions or built-in APIs for managing project interactions.

## Features
- **Project Dashboard**: Displays all projects created by the user.
- **Notes Section**: Allows users to add text-based notes to their projects.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images related to their projects.
- **Kanban Board**: Users can manage project tasks in a drag-and-drop board.

## Future Enhancements
- **Collaboration**: Add the ability for multiple users to collaborate on the same project.
- **Project Sharing**: Implement a feature that allows users to share a project link with others.
- **Project Templates**: Provide pre-defined project templates for users to quickly start a new project with example tasks and notes.
